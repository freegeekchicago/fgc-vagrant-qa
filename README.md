# Vagrant Test Suite:

A set of virtual machines for testing the FreeGeek Chicago install script.
We used to install [Xubuntu 14.04](https://xubuntu.org/news/14-04-release/) for laptops, and [Kubuntu 14.04](https://kubuntu.org/tag/kubuntu-14-04/) for desktops, but now we're installing [Linux Mint XFCE 18.3](https://www.linuxmint.com/rel_sylvia_xfce.php) on everything.

You will need to install [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/). Virtual machines are downloaded from [Vagrant Cloud](https://app.vagrantup.com/ahanson).
